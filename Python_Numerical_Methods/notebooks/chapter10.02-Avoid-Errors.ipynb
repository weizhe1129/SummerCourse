    "\n",
    "When writing an essay, it is important to have a structure and a\n",
    "direction that you intend to follow. To help make your structure more\n",
    "tangible, writing an essay usually starts with an outline containing the\n",
    "main points you wish to address in your paper. This is even more\n",
    "important to do when programming, because computers do not interpret what you write. When coding complicated\n",
    "programs, you should start with an outline of your program that addresses\n",
    "all the tasks you want your program to perform and in the order in which\n",
    "it should perform them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many novice programmers, eager to finish their assignments, will rush to the programming part without properly planning out the tasks\n",
    "needed to accomplish the given task. Haphazard planning results\n",
    "in equally haphazard code that is full of errors. Time spent planning\n",
    "out what you are trying to do is time well spent. Pre-planning will ensure that you will finish your program much faster than if you throw together a program without much thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does planning a program consist of? Recall in Chapter 3 that a\n",
    "function is defined as a sequence of instructions designed to perform a\n",
    "certain task. **module** is a function or group of functions that\n",
    "perform a certain task. It is important to design your program in terms\n",
    "of modules, especially for tasks that need to be repeated over and over\n",
    "again. Each module should accomplish a small, well-defined task and know\n",
    "as little information about other functions as possible (i.e., have a\n",
    "very limited set of inputs and outputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is to plan from the top to bottom, and then program\n",
    "from the bottom to the top. That is: decide what the overall program is\n",
    "supposed to do, determine what code is necessary to complete the main tasks, and then break the main tasks into components until the module\n",
    "is small enough that you are confident you can write it without errors."

    "## Test everything often\n",
    "\n",
    "When coding in modules, you should test each module using\n",
    "test cases for which you know the answer, and code enough cases to be\n",
    "confident that the function is working properly (including corner\n",
    "cases). For example, if you are writing a function that tells you\n",
    "whether a number is prime or not, you should test the function for\n",
    "inputs of 0 (corner case), 1 (corner case), 2 (simple yes), 4 (simple\n",
    "no), and 97 (complicated no). If all of your test cases proceed without error, you can\n",
    "move on to other modules, confident that the current module works\n",
    "correctly. **This is especially important if subsequent modules depend on\n",
    "or call the module you are working on**. If you do not test your code and assume that \n",
    "your incorrect code is\n",
    "correct, when you begin to get error messages in later\n",
    "modules, you will not know whether the error is in the module you are\n",
    "working on or in a previous module; this will make finding the error exponentially\n",
    "more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should test often, even within a single module or function.\n",
    "When you are working on a particular module that has several steps, you\n",

    "in the part of your code written since the last time you did test it.\n",

    "Just like good craftsmen keep their work area as clean as possible, free of unnecessary clutter, so should you keep your code as clean as possible.
