However, there is nothing special about base10 numbers except perhaps that you are more accustomed to using them. For example, in base3 we have the digits 0, 1, and 2 and the number $121(base\\ 3) = 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^1 + 1 \\cdot  3^0 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16(base\\ 10)$\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike humans that can abstract numbers to arbitrarily large values, computers have a fixed number of bits that they are capable of storing at one time. For example, a 32-bit computer can represent and process 32-digit binary numbers and no more. If all 32-bits are used to represent positive integer binary numbers, then this means that there are $\\sum_{n=0}^{31} 2^{n} = 4,294,967,296$ numbers the computer can represent. This is not very many numbers at all and would be completely insufficient to do any useful arithmetic on. For example, you could not compute the perfectly reasonable sum $0.5 + 1.25$ using this representation because all the bits are dedicated to only integers."
