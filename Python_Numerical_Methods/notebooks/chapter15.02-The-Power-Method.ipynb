    "## Find the largest eigenvalue\n",
    "\n",
    "In some problems, we only need to find the largest dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector. In this case, we can use the power method - a iterative method that will converge to the largest eigenvalue. Let's see the following how the power method works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an $n\\times{n}$ matrix $A$ that has $n$ linearly independent real eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_n$ and the corresponding eigenvectors $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$. Since the eigenvalues are scalars, we can rank them so that $|\\lambda_1| > |\\lambda_2| > \\dots > |\\lambda_n| $ (actually, we only require $|\\lambda_1| > |\\lambda_2|$, other eigenvalues may be equal to each other). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the eigenvectors are independent, they are a set of basis vectors, which means that any vector that is in the same space can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors. That is, for any vector $x_0$, it can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_0 = c_1v_1+c_2v_2+\\dots+c_nv_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_1\\ne0$ is the constraint. If it is zero, then we need to choose another initial vector so that $c_1\\ne0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's multiply both sides by $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ax_0 = c_1Av_1+c_2Av_2+\\dots+c_nAv_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $Av_i = \\lambda{v_i}$, we will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ax_0 = c_1\\lambda_1v_1+c_2\\lambda_2v_2+\\dots+c_n\\lambda_nv_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change the above equation to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ax_0 = c_1\\lambda_1[v_1+\\frac{c_2}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1}v_2+\\dots+\\frac{c_n}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_n}{\\lambda_1}v_n]= c_1\\lambda_1x_1$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_1$ is a new vector and $x_1 = v_1+\\frac{c_2}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1}v_2+\\dots+\\frac{c_n}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_n}{\\lambda_1}v_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finishes the first iteration. And we can multiply $A$ to $x_1$ to start the 2nd iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ax_1 = \\lambda_1{v_1}+\\frac{c_2}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_2^2}{\\lambda_1}v_2+\\dots+\\frac{c_n}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_n^2}{\\lambda_1}v_n $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can rearrange the above equation to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ax_1 = \\lambda_1[v_1+\\frac{c_2}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_2^2}{\\lambda_1^2}v_2+\\dots+\\frac{c_n}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_n^2}{\\lambda_1^2}v_n] = \\lambda_1x_2$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_2$ is another new vector and $x_2 = v_1+\\frac{c_2}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_2^2}{\\lambda_1^2}v_2+\\dots+\\frac{c_n}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_n^2}{\\lambda_1^2}v_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can continue multiply $A$ with the new vector we get from each iteration $k$ times:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ax_{k-1} = \\lambda_1[v_1+\\frac{c_2}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_2^k}{\\lambda_1^k}v_2+\\dots+\\frac{c_n}{c_1}\\frac{\\lambda_n^k}{\\lambda_1^k}v_n] = \\lambda_1x_k$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\lambda_1$ is the largest eigenvalue, therefore, the ratio $\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\lambda_1}<1$ for all $i>1$. Thus when we increase $k$ to sufficient large, the ratio of $(\\frac{\\lambda_n}{\\lambda_1})^{k}$ will be close to 0. So that all the terms that contain this ratio can be neglected as $k$ grows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ax_{k-1} = {\\lambda_1}v_1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, as $k$ is large enough, we will get the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector. When implementing this power method, we usually normalize the resulting vector in each iteration. This can be done by factoring out the largest element in the vector, which will make the largest element in the vector equal to 1. This normalization will get us the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector at the same time. Let's take a look of the following example. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask when should we stop the iteration? The basic stopping criteria should be one of the three: in the consecutive iterations, (1) the difference between eigenvalues is less than some specified tolerance; (2) the angle between eigenvectors is smaller than a threshold ; or the norm of the residual vector is small enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "**TRY IT!** We know from last section that the largest eigenvalue is 4 for matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 & 2\\\\\n",
    "2 & 3\\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$, now use the power method to find the largest eigenvalue and the associated eigenvector. You can use the initial vector [1, 1] to start the iteration. "
