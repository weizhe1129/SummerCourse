    "**Divide and conquer** is a useful strategy for solving difficult problems. Using divide and conquer, difficult problems are solved from solutions to many similar easy problems. In this way, difficult problems are broken up so they are more manageable. In this section, we cover two classical examples of divide and conquer: the Towers of Hanoi Problem and the Quicksort algorithm."

    "The Towers of Hanoi problem consists of three vertical rods, or towers, and *N* disks of different sizes, each with a hole in the center so that the rod can slide through it. The disks are originally stacked on one of the towers in order of descending size (i.e., the largest disc is on the bottom). The goal of the problem is to move all the disks to a different rod while complying with the following three rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "2. Only the disk at the top of a stack may be moved. \n",

    "A legend goes that a group of Indian monks are in a monastery working to complete a Towers of Hanoi problem with 64 disks. When they complete the problem, the world will end. Fortunately, the number of moves required is $2^{64} − 1$ so even if they could move one disk per millisecond, it would take over 584 million years for them to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to the Towers of Hanoi problem is breaking it down into smaller, easier-to-manage problems that we will refer to as **subproblems**. For this problem, it is relatively easy to see that moving a disk is easy (which has only three rules) but moving a tower is difficult (we cannot immediately see how to do it). So we will assign moving a stack of size *N* to several subproblems of moving a stack of size *N − 1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a stack of *N* disks that we wish to move from Tower 1 to Tower 3, and let *my_tower(N)* move a stack of size *N* to the desired tower (i.e., display the moves). How to write *my_tower* may not immediately be clear. However, if we think about the problem in terms of subproblems, we can see that we need to move the top *N-1* disks to the middle tower, then the bottom disk to the right tower, and then the *N-1* disks on the middle tower to the right tower. *my_tower* can display the instruction to move disk *N*, and then make recursive calls to *my_tower(N-1)* to handle moving the smaller towers. The calls to *my_tower(N-1)* make recursive calls to *my_tower(N-2)* and so on. A breakdown of the three steps is depicted in the following figure.\n",

    "Following is a recursive solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem. Notice its compactness and simplicity. The code exactly reflects our intuition about the recursive nature of the solution: First we move a stack of size *N-1* from the original tower 'from_tower' to the alternative tower 'alt_tower'. This is a difficult task, so instead we make a recursive call that will make subsequent recursive calls, but will, in the end, move the stack as desired. Then we move the bottom disk to the target tower 'to_tower'. Finally, we move the stack of size *N-1* to the target tower by making another recursive call.\n",

Together, the solutions form the solution to the whole problem. The actual work done by a single function call is actually quite small: two recursive calls and moving one disk. In other words, a function call does very little work (moving a disk), and then passes the rest of the work onto other calls, a skill you will probably find very useful throughout your engineering career."

At each recursive call to *quicksort*, the input list is divided into three parts: elements that are smaller than the pivot, elements that are equal to the pivot, and elements that are larger than the pivot. Then a recursive call to *quicksort* is made on the two subproblems: the list of elements smaller than the pivot and the list of elements larger than the pivot. Eventually the subproblems are small enough (i.e., list size of length 1 or 0) that sorting the list is trivial.\n",
