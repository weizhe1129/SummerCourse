    "The **complexity** of a function is the relationship between the size of the input and the difficulty of running the function to completion. The size of the input is usually denoted by $n$. However, $n$ usually describes something more tangible, such as the length of an array. The difficulty of a problem can be measured in several ways. One suitable way to describe the difficulty of the problem is to use **basic operations**: additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, assignments, and function calls. Although each basic operation takes different amounts of time, the number of basic operations needed to complete a function is sufficiently related to the running time to be useful, and it is much easier to count.\n",

    "A common notation for complexity is called **Big-O notation**. Big-O notation establishes the relationship in the growth of the number of basic operations with respect to the size of the input as the input size becomes very large. Since hardware is different on every machine, we cannot accurately calculate how long it will take to complete without also evaluating the hardware. Then that analysis is only good for that specific machine. We do not really care how long a specific set of input on a specific machine takes. Instead, we will analyze how quickly \"time to completion\" in terms of basic operations grows as the input size grows, because this analysis is hardware independent. As $n$ gets large, the highest power dominates; therefore, only the highest power term is included in Big-O notation. Additionally, coefficients are not required to characterize growth, and so coefficients are also dropped. In the previous example, we counted $4n^2 + n + 1$ basic operations to complete the function. In Big-O notation we would say that the function is $O(n^2)$ (pronounced \"O of n-squared\"). We say that any algorithm with complexity $O(nc)$ where $c$ is some constant with respect to $n$ is **polynomial time**.\n",
