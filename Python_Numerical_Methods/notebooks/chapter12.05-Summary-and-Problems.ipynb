    "# Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A cycloid is the curve traced by a point located on the edge of a wheel rolling along a flat surface. The $(x,y)$ coordinates of a cycloid generated from a wheel with radius, $r$, can be described by the parametric equations:\n",
    "\n",
    " $x = r(\\phi - \\sin{\\phi})$\n",
    "\n",
    " $y = r(1 - \\cos{\\phi})$\n",
    " \n",
    " where $\\phi$ is the number of radians that the wheel has rolled through.\n",
    " \n",
    " Generate a plot of the cycloid for $0 \\le \\phi \\le 2\\pi$ using 1000 increments and $r = 3$. Give your plot a title and labels. Turn the grid on and modify the axis limits to make the plot neat.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Consider the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    " $y(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{100(1-0.01x^2)^2 + 0.02x^2}{(1-x^2)^2 + 0.1x^2}}.$\n",
    "\n",
    " Generate a $2 \\times 2$ subplot of $y(x)$ for $0 \\le x \\le 100$ using *plot*, *semilogx*, *semilogy*, and *loglog*. Use a fine enough discretization in *x* to make the plot appear smooth. Give each plot axis labels and a title. Turn the grid on. Which plot seems to convey the most information?.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Plot the functions $y_1(x) = 3 + \\exp{-x}\\sin{(6x)}$ and $y_2(x) = 4 + \\exp{(-x)}\\cos{(6x)}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 5$ on a single axis. Give the plot axis labels, a title, and a legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generate 1000 normally distributed random numbers using the *np.random.randn* function. Look up the help for the *plt.hist* function. Use the *plt.hist* function to plot a histogram of the randomly generated numbers. Use the *plt.hist* function to distribute the randomly generated numbers into 10 bins. Create a bar graph of output of hist using the *plt.bar* function. It should look very similar to the plot produced by *plt.hist*.\n",
    "\n",
    " Do you think that the *np.random.randn* function is a good approximation of a normally distributed number?. \n",
    " \n",
    "5. Let the number of students with A's, B's, C's, D's, and F's be contained in the list *grade_dist = [42, 85, 67, 20, 5]*. Use the *plt.pie* function to generate a pie chart of *grade_dist*. Put a title and legend on the pie chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Let $-4 \\le x \\le 4, -3 \\le y \\le 3$, and $z(x,y) = \\frac{xy(x^2 - y^2)}{x^2 + y^2}$. Create arrays *x* and *y* with 100 evenly spaced points over the interval. Create meshgrids *X* and *Y* for *x* and *y* using the *meshgrid* function. Compute the matrix *Z* from *X* and *Y* . Create a $1 \\times 2$ subplot where the first figure is the 3D surface *Z* plotted using *plt.plot_surface* and the second figure is the 3D wireframe plot using *plt.plot_wireframe*, respectively. Give each axis a title and axis labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Write a function *my_polygon(n)* that plots a regular polygon with *n* sides and radius 1. Recall that the radius of a regular polygon is the distance from its centroid to the vertices. Use *plt.axis('equal')* to make the polygon look regular. Remember to give the axes a label and a title. You can use *plt.title* to title the plot according to the number of sides. Hint: This problem is significantly easier if you think in polar coordinates. Recall that a complete revolution around the unit circle is $2\\pi$ radians. Note: The first and last point on the polygon should be the point associated with the polar coordinate angles, $0$ and $2\\pi$, respectively. \n",

Write a function *my_sierpinski (n)* that generates the points $p_i$ for $i = 1,\\cdots,n$.
