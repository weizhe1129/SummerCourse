    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A function is a self-contained set of instructions designed to do a specific task.\n",
    "2. A function has its own memory block for its variables.Information can be added to a function's memory block only through a function's input variables. Information can leave the function's memory block only through a function's output variables.\n",
    "3. A function can be defined within another function, called nested function. This nested function can be only accessed by the parent function. \n",
    "4. You can define anonymous function using keyword lambda, the so called lambda function. \n",
    "5. You can assign functions to variables using function handles."
