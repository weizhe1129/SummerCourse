    "In the previous section, we talked about how the floating point numbers are represented in computers as base 2 fractions. This has a side effect that the floating point numbers can not be stored with perfect precision, instead the numbers are approximated by finite number of bytes. Therefore, the difference between an approximation of a number used in computation and its correct (true) value is called **round-off error**. It is one of the common errors usually in the numerical calculations. The other one is **truncation error** which we will introduce in [Chapter 18](chapter18.03-Truncation-Errors.ipynb). The difference is that truncation error is the error made by truncating an infinite sum and approximating it by a finite sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation error\n",
    "The most common form round-off error is the representation error in the floating point numbers. A simple example will be to represent $\\pi$. We know that $\\pi$ is an infinite number, but when we use it, we usually only use a finite digits. For example, if you only use 3.14159265, there will be an error between this approximation and the true infinite number. Another example will be 1/3, the true value will be 0.333333333..., no matter how many decimal digits we choose, there is an round-off error as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, when we rounding the numbers multiple times, the error will accumulate. For instance, if 4.845 is rounded to two decimal places, it is 4.85. Then if we round it again to one decimal place, it is 4.9, the total error will be 0.55. But if we only round one time to one decimal place, it is 4.8, which the error is 0.045. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Round-off error by floating-point arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above example, the error between 4.845 and 4.8 should be 0.055. But if you calculate it in Python, you will see the 4.9 - 4.845 is not equal to 0.055. "
